            This is an awesome project aimed to better my understanding of html and how websites work.
            My end goal is to create a webpage in which to post my portfolio and other things in.
            With the help of my class and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> I shall accomplish my goals that I set upon myself!
            My webpage will be great!

            <p>I have been playing around with a lot with the free game engine, Unity. I still don't know what I'm doing 
            most of the time, but it is still pretty cool viewing other peoples work and breaking it down to learn how 
            each script works. Thus begins my project on Unity... I may even put it up on this website somewhere.</p>

            <h2 class = "heading">Programing</h2>
            <p>After what feels like years of learing the concept of how programs work I have come to the realization that
            every program, from the most complicated software to the most simple little flash game, are all composed of
            the most basic of logic, math and varibles. Once you gather the basic knowledge of a language all you need to
            do is put them togeather in the correct way; much like a sentence in English, Spanish, Russian, ect. To 
            simply put it, programming is much like writing a book or essay.</p>
